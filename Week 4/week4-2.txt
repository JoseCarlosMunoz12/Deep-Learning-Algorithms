Week 4 
lesson 2 Programming stuff
input later, Dense layers, outputlaers
output is Linear, Sigmid or sofmax
input mostly ReLu or tanh
Dense layer, every output of layer to next one is a dense layer
///
each layer computes a tensor. ex 16 neuron will output. Layers can be split into more dimensions.
Doesnt say how many will appear in next layer.
idea
first layer, capture very detail features. Beggining layers have more features than the next one
Smaller features group into a larger features. Merge features. Each block reduces feature amount
how many you begin with, is a work of art. It depends alot.
These numbers depond on what we are doing or going to solve
