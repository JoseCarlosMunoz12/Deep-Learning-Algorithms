Week 4 lesson 1
Loss/Gradient of Basic Environement
Today, Some calculus and probability. Linear algebra as well
All we are doing is Fedforward networks.
Look at models we create by it
Essentially, 
Some distribution  D on (x, y)
there is a function but there is noise. Therefore a distribution
we make a model to compute the value of our y^ corresponding to our target variable
we essentially calcute the probabily that our value will be in our distribution
P_{model}(y^|X,thete)
given our parameter we get some value by half.
want to have the differnet between the two.
P_D(y|x) - P_M(y,x^,thete)
becasue probability, we calculate the Expected value
E_{x~d}(P_D(x^)) - P_M(x^)) to be as small we can
Minimize the expectatin
use logs for techincal reason. cause easier to do sums than multiplication
---
we don't need to compare P_D so it is fixed and we can forget about it
leaves us -log(P_M), this is just cross entropy between distribution
Cross entropy, difference what we know and what we want to fix
//-----
comes becase we want to minimize it
we want the best value of our thete, our parameters
theta = argmax E(p_M(y,x;thete)
maximum likelyhood estimate.
//==
want maximum distribution of y we computed
p(y|f(x^,theta))
//==
normalize data from the start
//==
Loss Funcion ther are 3 types of loss functions. Regression binary, and multiclass classification
Regression, assume normal Disrtibution
distributed with Laplcae
0.5 * b^-1 exp(-(y-y^)/b)
most of time assume normal distribution, use sme
Binary Classification max likehoold yield
plogp^ + (1-p)log(1-p^)
multiclass yields -log(y^)
probability of true class with given value
//==
Loss function table will be used. All of these are enough to use
its gonna be one of these at the end. So the loss, will be one of the from the table
Gradients of these as well. will be used for the activation function
//==
After each value calculated, its passed to the previous node. Back propagatin
//==
Must need to write it as a matrix multiplication
Techincal view.
indices reverse for backpropagation
Read about the recurrence equation.
all derivatvs are already built in the first Matrix.
Look at page 22 to see all the standard cases for forwared and backward 
//=======
These are basic function for the back propagation
//
Batch Learning.
Train one record at a time. called online learning. Mostly used when dta is coming in real time
Batch training
train many recoreds at an instance.
Stochasitc Gradient descent. Randomly choose any of the points and train. 
Stochastic Sampling. Sample first few and train it.
Replacement Sampling. same as sample but return data sampled
training one bactch is calle an iteration
full data is called an epoch
//=====
Loss Function in Batch learning.
use mean square error. add all and get the mean. Sometimes its total squared error
for all update, we use the same result of gradient descent
Multiclass perceptron. many layer of many perceptron
Perceptron, linearly seperates points.
Idea: point belongs to class with the biggest distance of w * x
Softmax is most. if multiclass softmax, real numbers, regression, if probability , sigmoid
all can be made form ReLu, sigmoid and Softmax
