Week 5 lesson 1
Example of extracting features form a Picture
Goal to detect an object in am image
//picture repesentation of object in picture
whatever method is used to recognize object should not be concerned with the precise location of the object in the image
*Invariance- transformation of the board doesn't affect the image
our NN should be able to take this into account and transiontional invariance
*Locality Principle- not all data points but parts that matter to it
*Each early Layer should enhance a feature
What is Transitional invariance
----------
Training, Testing, Classificatin
Training-Giving Data. NOT ABLE TO CHANGE FEATURES OR LABELS. IDEAL System is to seperate them well. and classify them well
Validation Data- Feed into network and see if it correctly seperates data
Testing Data- Goal to validate the NN and see if it perfoms well
Testing Data used once
----------
Convolutional Netwroks
Transitional INvariance. if we move it , translate, it, still same thing
****Need to see video of Transiontal INvariance and Feature extraction****
Convergence of board into a new Board.
Anything out of the locality, is of no use and assume to be a zero
Convolutional Filtering-used to discovered basic features
Use a filtering to get basic features from it
the kernel help determine the values and weighs of the value
V is the kernel, X is the data set
Nessarry allows us to use cross correlation. Convolution is much harder. Limit it by size. 
-Cross correlation Kernel-
are domain aware networks. THink matrix as geometrical position. geomoetry matter
Implemented as a tensor product
Good thing about is the back propogation has decomvolution. allows to compute back propogation
